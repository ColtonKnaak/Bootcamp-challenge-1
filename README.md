# Horiseon code refactor

## Description

This project is a code refactor to make the previous code more efficient, and accessible in the Horiseon homepage. This should also improve in search engine optimization. This project helped me learn how to make html more organized and easier to sort stuff out.

### Tasks completed

- HTML elements were replaced with semantic HTML elements
- CSS was rorganized to follow a logical structure
- Removed unnecessary CSS classes
- A improved title was added
- Alt text was added to the images
